# Image Forgery Detection Using ELA
This project detects image forgery using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and a deep-learning model (MobileNetV2). It generates a synthetic dataset, converts images to ELA format, trains a classifier to distinguish authentic vs forged images, and provides evaluation metrics and a prediction tool for new images.
